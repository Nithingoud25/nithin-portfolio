<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
My name is B. Nithin Goud. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech 3rd year in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) at Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology.
I am a person who loves learning new things, especially in the field of technology and programming.</p>

<p>I have been learning Python, DBMS, Probability & Statistics, and Web Development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
   I always try to understand concepts from the basics, and I prefer learning in a simple and clear way.</p>

<p>Apart from studies, I am also interested in fitness and calisthenics. I usually work out at 6:00 AM, doing push-ups, pull-ups, and sit-ups to stay fit and energetic.</p>

<p>I believe in continuous improvement. Even if I find something difficult at first, I keep trying until I understand it completely.
   I am honest, hardworking, and curious by nature, and I always aim to give my best in whatever I do.</p>
